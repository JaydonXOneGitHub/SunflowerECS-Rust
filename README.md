# SunflowerECS-Rust

SunflowerECS-Rust is a hybrid ECS library designed for use in Rust applications.<br>
It's based on my https://github.com/JaydonXOneGitHub/SunflowerECS library, which was made in C#.

# How To Use
Install the library, either by using `cargo add sunflowerecs` or by manually copying the repo and linking to it.

To use:

```rs
fn main() -> () {

}
```
